# subtitle: Why you'd want to go on a date with me
---

I’m currently a 6th year Applied Physics Ph.D. student at Stanford University. I’m working in the Laboratory for Integrated Nano-Quantum Systems led by Prof. Amir Safavi-Naeini. 

My current research focuses on building quantum hardware based on superconducting circuits and nanomechanical resonators. I have expertise in designing, fabricating, and characterizing these integrated quantum devices. Last summer, I was an intern at the AWS Center for Quantum Computing, where I learned a lot about what it takes to build a large-scale superconducting quantum computer. I previously received my B.S. in physics from Rice University. During that time, I worked in Prof. Junichiro Kono’s lab at Rice University, where I characterized quantum materials using terahertz time-domain spectroscopy. 

Outside of my research, I love skiing and climbing. 

<!-- ### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions. -->
